# L.O.T.U.S.
## Or, better known as "Limited Optical Tracking, Use Sonar"

L.O.T.U.S. is a top-down 2d dungeon-exploration game, created as my official entry into the GitHub Game-Off Game Jam, 2022.
You're blind, you're lost, but you're a goddamned echolocating genius thanks to the teachings from your blind mentor. Speaking of, they've been captured and need you to come help them! Use your refined skillset to delve into the ~~evil~~ very nice Dr. Hargren's underground lair and save your mentor!
