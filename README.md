# L.O.T.U.S.
## Or, better known as "Limited Optical Tracking, Use Sonar"

L.O.T.U.S. is a top-down 2d dungeon-exploration game, created as my official entry into the GitHub Game-Off Game Jam, 2022.
You are a blind explorer, searching for your mentor who has been kidnapped by the ~~evil~~ Dr. Hargen. What's worse, is that the Doc has stolen sight from your mentor as well!
