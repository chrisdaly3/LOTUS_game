# L.O.T.U.S.
## Or, better known as "Limited Optical Tracking, Use Sonar"

L.O.T.U.S. is a top-down 2d dungeon-exploration game, created as my official entry into the GitHub Game-Off Game Jam, 2022.

As a sightless understudy to the famed Martin Pluth (Head Architect & Investigator of Pluth Exploratory School for the Blind), you've been taught how to harness an incredibly powerful tool.

And it's a good thing, too.

Martin's been kidnapped, and is being held at ransom until the School turns over a sum of proprietary blueprints to the world's most valuable dig sites.

It'll be up to you to navigate your way and rescue Martin, relying on the skills he's taught you over the many years together. But beware, there's not much oxygen when you're underground...
